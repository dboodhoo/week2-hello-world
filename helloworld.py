# write a program that:
# 1. greets the user in English
# 2. asks the user to choose from 1 of 3 spoken languages (pick your favorite languages!) 
# 3. displays the greeting in the chosen language
# 4. exits

# make sure that your code contains comments explaining your logic!
one = '¡Hola! ¿Cómo estás?'
two = 'Hello! How are you?'
three = 'Ahoj! Jak se máš?'
# the text above is for the greetings. The number 1 did not work so I got so confused and went with the numerical words instead. I apologize.
print('Hello World!')
print('Please choose a language and I wil greet you in that language!')
#above asks the user to select a language and below presents the lanuages to choose from.
print('one-Spanish')
print('two-English')
print('three-Czech')
